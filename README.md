# Bandpass Filter Challenge - Ruby

## Description

A bandpass filter is a device that passes frequencies within a certain range and rejects frequencies outside that range. 

This project was built using test-driven development (TDD) with Ruby & RSpec.

## Specification

### Core Requirements

You'll be given a sound wave in the form of an array on integers with an upper and lower limit. If any of the frequencies within the wave exceeds any of the two boundries, the frequency should be set to it's closest boundry. When the soundwave has passed through the filter, the soundwave is returned.

Example 1 (No Change): 
```
Input = ( 
[80, 60, 70, 50, 60], // Soundwave
30, // Lower Limit
100 // Upper Limit
)

Output = [80, 60, 70, 50, 60]
```
Example 2 (Exceeds upper boundary):
```
Input = ( 
[80, 50, 110, 70, 80], // Soundwave
40, // Lower Limit
100 // Upper Limit
)

Output = [80, 50, 100, 70, 80]
```
Example 3 (Exceeds lower boundary):
```
Input = ( 
[80, 30, 90, 70, 80], // Soundwave
40, // Lower Limit
100 // Upper Limit
)

Output = [80, 40, 90, 70, 80]
```
### Edge Cases

- Error: The input array should contain 5 frequencies to make up a soundwave, those an argument error if the array is not 5.
- Error: The input array should only contain integers, throw an argument error if there's any strings. 
- Error: The input array should contain only positive numbers, throw an argument error if the number is below 0.
